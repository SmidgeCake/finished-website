                                <p> IT and Digital Media Level 1 is a great starting point for people looking to progress onto a Level 2 course or apprenticeship. It includes several practical learning opportunities. For example, as part of the course, I had the opportunity to go on a trip to Yamazaki Mazak, where we toured and learned about their technology. A trip to Yamazaki Mazak isnâ€™t guaranteed, but there will be several other learning opportunities on different trips throughout the year. During the course, there are many fun projects to do as well as the normal units, such as Introduction to Coding, Computing Hardware, and more.<br>
                                    <br>This would be the perfect course for anybody with an interest in starting to learn about IT or Digital Media. The course is assessed with a number of assignments, and you will receive support from college facilities with your studies, emotional well-being, and advice on how to get where you want to in the future.
